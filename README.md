## Q1 -	Identify and explain the workings of TWO sorting algorithms and discuss and compare their performance/efficiency (i.e. Big O)	Minimum 300 words

- Quick Sort is a type of sorting algorithm process that uses a technique called the Divide and Conquer Technique, it is a technique that helps put the small groups of an array back into one group to find the reasoning behind the original problem. The main role of the Quick Sort Algorithm is a partition it grabs any element from the array and rotates it into its correct place, this an essential process of sorting the array. To be able to use the Quick Sort Algorithm you need to use the array of elements which are numbers written in code inside of the brackets, for example ```  {2, 5, 1, 6, 4, 3} ``` sorted elements in a array will be in order and look like this example:  ``` {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ``` The efficiency of using this sorting Algorithm is exactly as it sounds, it's the quickest way of sorting an algorithm. It is also known to be one of best sorting algorithms for its ability to sort long lists along with not needing you to use any extra storage. The downside to Quick sort is the elements in a list may already be sorted this is when bubble sort is better off being used but only when the list isn't too long. 

- Bubble Sort is one of the easiest sorting algorithms to understand, compared to the Quick sort algorithm is simple but not ideal for big chunks of data and it can take some time to actually use this algorithm. Bubble sort algorithm works by traveling from the left and compares the elements it will then place the highest digit to the right.

- Linear Search is a algorithm that works from the start of an array to the end in chronological order to find the right element that is in the list.

- Binary Search has a simple yet important job of finding the value in a list that is sorted, this is done by the Binary search going
