## Q1 -	Identify and explain the workings of TWO sorting algorithms and discuss and compare their performance/efficiency (i.e. Big O)	Minimum 300 words

- Quick Sort Algorithm is a process that takes the main chunk of data and breaks it down into small groups to help problem solve the code, a part of this alogorithm process is to use the Divide and Conquer Technique. This technique puts the small groups back into one group to find the reasoning behind the original problem. The main focus of Quick Sort Algorithm is a partition, its job is to grab any element and rotate it into its correct place it is an essential process of sorting the array. To be able to use the Quick Sort Algorithm you need to use the array of elements which are numbers written in code inside of brackets, for example ```  {2, 5, 1, 6, 4, 3} ``` sorted elements should be in order and look like this  ``` {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ``` The efficiency of using this sorting Algorithm is exsactly as it sounds, it's quick! and is also the quickest was of sorting an algorithm. The downside
